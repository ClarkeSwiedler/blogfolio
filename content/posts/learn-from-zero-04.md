In Dart, as well as in many other programming languages, variables are declared to hold only a specific _type_ of data. Dart supports seven different data types, and... well, here they are:

| Keyword  | Type                          | Description                                                                                                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `int`    | Integer                       | A whole number (Any numeric value without a decimal point, like `42`)                                         |
| `double` | Decimal number                | Any number with a fractional part, represented as a decimal, like `28.45`                                     |
| `String` | Text                          | A set of characters within single or double quotation marks. `"This is a String"`, `'This is also a String'`. |
| `List`   | Ordered collection            | An ordered list of values or objects.                                                                         |
| `Map`    | Collection of Key/Value pairs | A set of values each associated with a key                                                                    |

## Using types



## Why are types handy?

Types come in handy for many reasons.

  1. They give the compiler in idea of how much space needs to be reserved in memory in order to store the variable.
  2. They give the programmer some idea of what sort of things can be done with a variable, and what kind of data it's expected to hold.
