# Coding from Zero using Dart / Flutter 01 - Introduction and Setup

## Introduction

In this series of articles we will be learning how to create cross-platform mobile (and eventually web and desktop) applications using the Dart programming language and the Flutter UI framework.

Many resources for learning this framework assume prior knowledge of how to write code in some other language, and basic concepts of programming. This is awesome for people familiar with software development to get up and running quickly, but leaves those who are just learning to write code with a lot of catching up to do.

Conversely, many resources for learning how to code from scratch leave a lot of questions unanswered and often don't have the great payoff of making something working and usable by the end of the lessons.

This series will attempt to solve both of those issues by starting with the very barest fundamentals of programming and working all the way through learning how to build the production-ready application you've always dreamed of.

The goals of this tutorial series are as follows:

1. Be accessible for someone who has never seen or written a single line of code.
2. Be as concise as possible.
3. Be flexible in examples and explanations so they may be adapted to personal projects rather than only being relevant within the context of this tutorial.
4. Provide relevant exercises after learning new concepts.
5. Teach core principles of modern, clean code organization from the beginning.
6. Provide a jumping-in point later on for those already familiar with software development who just want to learn Dart/Flutter.
7. Provide a second jumping-in point futher on for those already familiar with Dart/Flutter who want to learn how to build real, scalable production apps.

At the end of this introductory article I will talk a little bit about myself, if you're interested, but for now let's jump straight into...
